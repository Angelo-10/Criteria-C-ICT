    <p class="Title">About this PC</p>
    <p class="Para">The PC that I have built today is an elegant display of an ideal computer for a designer as they are required to render large softwares quickly without having the possibility of crashing and losing important doccuments. The total cost of this PC is $5,985.69 including the input and output devices.</p>
    <p class="Para">This computer will be able to render complex softwares including but not limited to, Sketchup Pro, Autodesk AutoCAD LT, TurboCAD, and Archicad 25 without the risk of the computer crashing and losing important documents. Adding on, the computer also generally runs quickly with limited lagging and no crashing. In addition, due to the highly professional components of the PC, it allows the graphics displayed to be incredible and the responsiveness of the computer to be near instant. As well as the storage being over one terabite whilst all still having an amusing 90% energy efficiency. </p>
    <p class="Para">The complete desktop will use an estimated 200 Watt hours (Wh). This is the sum of the average consumption per hour of the computer itself (171 W), the internet modem (10 W), the printer (5 W) and the loudspeakers (20 W). Assuming that a computer is on for eight hours a day, the annual consumption comes to 600 kWh.</p>
